# midasr

Package for estimating and testing MIDAS regression. Currently only very basic
functionality is supported. The main feature of this package is function
hAh.test which performs test whether coefficients of MIDAS regression have
certain functional form.

To install download the latest version from my [blog][1].
Then install the file as local R package. 


# Development
To install the development version of midasr, it's easiest to use the `devtools` package:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github("midasr","mpiktas")
